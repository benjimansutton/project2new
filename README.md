The project was meant to be like this.

First Page (index.html) Was where the user created a username then started the game by pressing submit. This would then Send the user to game.html.

game.html would then have the users name above the game area, the correct and inncorrect scores below the box. The user would then start the game, answer the questions with the scores updating at the bottom. Then once the questions are answered and the score completed the user would then see a final congradulations or failure page with the scores they got on it.

The users name would be stored in sessionStorage
